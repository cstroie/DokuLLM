====== Profiles ======

Profiles in DokuLLM allow you to organize and customize your AI interactions. Each profile can have its own set of actions, prompts, and configurations. By default, the plugin uses the [[.:default|default]] profile, but you can create and switch between multiple profiles as needed.

===== Available Profiles =====

The following profiles are currently available:                                                                        
  * [[.:default|default]] - The standard profile with basic actions
  * //Add your custom profiles here//

===== Creating a New Profile =====

To create a new profile:

  - Create a new page at ''dokullm:profiles:PROFILE_NAME'' (replace PROFILE_NAME with your desired profile name)
  - Add a table defining the actions available in this profile (see below for format)
  - Configure the plugin to use your new profile in the plugin settings                                                 

===== Profile Action Table Format =====

Each profile page should contain a table defining the available actions. The table must have the following columns:

^ ID ^ Label ^ Description ^ Icon ^ Result ^
| action_id | Button Text | Description of what the action does | icon_name | result_action_type |

Column details:
  * **ID**: The action identifier, which corresponds to the prompt name
  * **Label**: The text displayed on the button
  * **Description**: A detailed description of the action, used as a tooltip
  * **Icon**: The icon displayed on the button (can be empty)
  * **Result**: The action to perform with the LLM result:
    * ''show'': Display the result in a modal dialog
    * ''append'': Add the result to the end of the current content
    * ''replace'': Replace the selected content with the result
    * ''insert'': Insert the result at the cursor position

==== Example Profile Table ====

Here's an example of how to structure your profile action table:

^ ID ^ Label ^ Description ^ Icon ^ Result ^
| summarize | Summarize | Create a summary of the selected text | file-icons:summary | show |
| expand | Expand | Expand the selected text with more details | file-icons:expand | replace |
| fix_grammar | Fix Grammar | Correct grammar and spelling errors | file-icons:spellcheck | replace |

===== Using Profiles =====                                                                                             

To use a specific profile:
  - Go to the plugin configuration page
  - Find the "Prompt Profile" setting
  - Enter the name of the profile you want to use
  - Save the configuration

The selected profile will be used for all LLM interactions until you change it.

===== Adding Custom User Prompts =====

Each action in your profile corresponds to a prompt page. To add a custom prompt:
  - Create a new page at ''dokullm:profiles:PROFILE_NAME:PROMPT_NAME'' (replace PROFILE_NAME with your new profile and PROMPT_NAME with your action ID)
  - Write your prompt in this page, using placeholders as needed:
    * ''{text}'' - The selected text from the editor or the entire text
    * ''{template}'' - The template associated with the request
    * The prompt will automatically be available through the action defined in your profile

===== Metadata Support =====

DokuLLM supports metadata in your wiki pages, which can be used to provide additional context to the LLM (spaces inserted to prevent processing, remove them):
  * ''~ ~LLM_TEMPLATE:template_id~~'' - Specifies a template to use as context
  * ''~ ~LLM_EXAMPLES:example1,example2~~'' - Specifies example pages to use as context
  * ''~ ~LLM_PREVIOUS:previous_page~~'' - Specifies a previous document to use as context

These metadata tags should be placed at the beginning of your wiki page.
