====== Extending System Prompts in DokuLLM ======

DokuLLM supports a hierarchical system prompt architecture that allows for fine-grained control over LLM behavior for specific actions. This extension mechanism enables you to provide additional context and instructions that are specific to individual operations.

===== Extension Mechanism =====

The system works by automatically checking for command-specific system prompt extensions when processing any action. The extension follows this file path convention:

  ''doc/profiles/[PROFILE_NAME]/[ACTION_NAME]/system''

For example:
  * ''doc/profiles/default/summarize/system''
  * ''doc/profiles/default/create/system''
  * ''doc/profiles/medical/analyze/system''

===== How It Works =====

1. **Base System Prompt Loading**: When any action is initiated, the main system prompt is first loaded from:
   ''doc/profiles/[PROFILE_NAME]/system''

2. **Command-Specific Extension Check**: The system then checks if a command-specific system prompt extension exists:
   ''doc/profiles/[PROFILE_NAME]/[ACTION_NAME]/system''

3. **Automatic Appendage**: If the extension exists, its content is automatically appended to the base system prompt with a newline separator.

4. **Fallback Behavior**: If the extension doesn't exist, the system simply uses the base system prompt without any additional instructions.

===== Use Cases =====

==== Action-Specific Guidelines ====

Command extensions are ideal for providing action-specific guidance that supplements the general system instructions. For example:

Base System Prompt (''doc/profiles/default/system''):
  You are a helpful assistant specialized in text processing tasks...

Summarize Extension (''doc/profiles/default/summarize/system''):
  When summarizing content, focus on the key findings and conclusions.
  Create a concise executive summary that captures the most important information.
  Limit your summary to 3-5 bullet points.

Combined Result:
  You are a helpful assistant specialized in text processing tasks...
  [base instructions...]
  
  When summarizing content, focus on the key findings and conclusions.
  Create a concise executive summary that captures the most important information.
  Limit your summary to 3-5 bullet points.

==== Specialized Processing Instructions ====

Extensions can provide detailed processing instructions that are unique to each action:
  * Analysis Extension: Specify analytical frameworks and evaluation criteria
  * Comparison Extension: Define comparison methodologies and focus areas
  * Rewrite Extension: Provide style guidelines and content restructuring rules
  * Create Extension: Outline content generation templates and required sections

===== Best Practices =====

1. **Complementary Content**: Extensions should complement, not contradict, the base system prompt
2. **Concise Instructions**: Keep extensions focused and specific to the action
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent style with the base system prompt
4. **Profile Awareness**: Create profile-specific extensions when using multiple profiles
5. **Testing**: Test extensions thoroughly to ensure they produce desired behavior

===== Example Structure =====

  doc/profiles/default/
  ├── system                    # Base system prompt
  ├── summarize.txt             # Summarize action prompt
  ├── summarize/
  │   └── system                # Summarize-specific system extension
  ├── expand.txt                # Expand action prompt
  ├── expand/
  │   └── system                # Expand-specific system extension
  ├── grammar.txt               # Grammar action prompt
  └── grammar/
      └── system                # Grammar-specific system extension

This extension mechanism provides powerful flexibility in customizing LLM behavior for different actions while maintaining a consistent foundational set of instructions.
