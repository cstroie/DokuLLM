====== Extending System Prompts in DokuLLM ======

DokuLLM supports a hierarchical system prompt architecture that allows for fine-grained control over LLM behavior for specific actions. This extension mechanism enables you to provide additional context and instructions that are specific to individual operations.

===== Extension Mechanism =====

The system works by automatically checking for command-specific system prompt extensions when processing any action. The extension follows this page naming convention:

  ''dokullm:profiles:[PROFILE_NAME]:[ACTION_NAME]:system''

For example:
  * ''dokullm:profiles:default:summarize:system''
  * ''dokullm:profiles:default:create:system''
  * ''dokullm:profiles:medical:analyze:system''

===== How It Works =====

1. **Base System Prompt Loading**: When any action is initiated, the main system prompt is first loaded from:
   ''dokullm:profiles:[PROFILE_NAME]:system''

2. **Command-Specific Extension Check**: The system then checks if a command-specific system prompt extension exists:
   ''dokullm:profiles:[PROFILE_NAME]:[ACTION_NAME]:system''

3. **Automatic Appendage**: If the extension exists, its content is automatically appended to the base system prompt with a newline separator.

4. **Fallback Behavior**: If the extension doesn't exist, the system simply uses the base system prompt without any additional instructions.

===== Use Cases =====

==== Action-Specific Guidelines ====

Command extensions are ideal for providing action-specific guidance that supplements the general system instructions. For example:

Base System Prompt (''dokullm:profiles:default:system''):
  You are a helpful assistant specialized in text processing tasks...

Summarize Extension (''dokullm:profiles:default:summarize:system''):
  When summarizing content, focus on the key findings and conclusions.
  Create a concise executive summary that captures the most important information.
  Limit your summary to 3-5 bullet points.

Combined Result:
  You are a helpful assistant specialized in text processing tasks...
  [base instructions...]
  
  When summarizing content, focus on the key findings and conclusions.
  Create a concise executive summary that captures the most important information.
  Limit your summary to 3-5 bullet points.

==== Specialized Processing Instructions ====

Extensions can provide detailed processing instructions that are unique to each action:
  * Analysis Extension: Specify analytical frameworks and evaluation criteria
  * Comparison Extension: Define comparison methodologies and focus areas
  * Rewrite Extension: Provide style guidelines and content restructuring rules
  * Create Extension: Outline content generation templates and required sections

===== Best Practices =====

1. **Complementary Content**: Extensions should complement, not contradict, the base system prompt
2. **Concise Instructions**: Keep extensions focused and specific to the action
3. **Consistent Formatting**: Maintain consistent style with the base system prompt
4. **Profile Awareness**: Create profile-specific extensions when using multiple profiles
5. **Testing**: Test extensions thoroughly to ensure they produce desired behavior

===== Example Structure =====

  dokullm:profiles:default:
  ├── system                    # Base system prompt
  ├── summarize                 # Summarize action prompt
  ├── summarize:system          # Summarize-specific system extension
  ├── expand                    # Expand action prompt
  ├── expand:system             # Expand-specific system extension
  ├── grammar                   # Grammar action prompt
  └── grammar:system            # Grammar-specific system extension

This extension mechanism provides powerful flexibility in customizing LLM behavior for different actions while maintaining a consistent foundational set of instructions.
